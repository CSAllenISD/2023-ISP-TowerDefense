# 2023-ISP-TowerDefense
Stefano Tower Defense HD is a tower defense game with multiple levels, towers, and upgrades where the goal is to stop the evil clones Stefano from finishing the track and entering the populated areas. There will be at least 8 different towers to choose from, each with 8 unique upgrades in order to make every game unique. Every upgrade will have unique physical properties as well as new abilities, with the farther you go into a path, the more costly and powerful the upgrade will be. Each level will have different enemy types attempting to pass you, and some enemies are immune to some projectiles, so you must create your defenses accordingly and not let too many through, or you lose and must restart the level. When you complete all the levels, you will be greeted with a final, very hard level, which after completion, will unlock a secret game to complete the hidden story expressed in the levels.
